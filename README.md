## Core Features

o324 runs as a system daemon, providing a robust and seamless tracking experience through a powerful CLI.

*   üß† **Intelligent Session Grouping:** Automatically aggregates work and break periods into cohesive sessions, complete with an objective activity score.
*   üîç **Automated Activity Detection:** Monitors system activity (e.g., window titles, idle state) to eliminate manual timer management and ensure precision.
*   üîí **Data Integrity Engine:** Automatically stops active tasks on system sleep or shutdown (with a 3-minute grace period), preventing corrupted or abandoned timers.
*   üîî **Proactive Nudges:** Delivers notifications when you appear to be working without an active timer, helping you maintain a consistent log.
*   ‚ö° **Dynamic CLI:** A high-performance command-line interface with in-memory caching of task ID prefixes for swift, frictionless interaction (inspired by `jujutsu`).
*   ‚òÅÔ∏è **Device Synchronization (Planned):** Sync your work sessions securely across multiple machines.
