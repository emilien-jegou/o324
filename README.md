# 3to4

An open source CLI and GUI time tracker for linux developed in rust.

> ⚠️ Project in active development.

# Introduction

This project aims to create an open-source time tracking solution featuring a customizable storage layer. Many us value having control over their data, yet often find themselves tied to proprietary options due to a lack of suitable open-source alternatives. This project seeks to address this gap by offering a software solution that operates effectively without compromising on data control.
